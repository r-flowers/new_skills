specific questions for right now:

i think i understand what the code is doing in pseudocode but i think i need to go over how the proper syntax works again, for what i'm trying to do with this skill-search.

how do i structure accessing the form data properly, and use that to search and display?

long-term questions:

how do i add full user profiles with emails/email authentication, passwords, logging in and out? (and different types of user privileges e.g. users, mods, admins)

how can i allow users to create hubs and post comments on those hubs?

how can i allow users to send private messages to each other?

BUGS TO BE DEALT WITH:

currently everything to do with searching in a case sensitive way is pretty fucked.
